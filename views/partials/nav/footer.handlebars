            <h5>Hi, there!</h5>
            <p>
                At Woofer, we see dogs as family. We understand 
                that getting enough playtime with others is 
                important to your pup's wellbeing. We also 
                understand that--just like people--dog's get along 
                with some better than others. That's why we created 
                Woofer, to bring you a simple way of connecting with 
                potential playmates.
            </p>
